main function:
	Used to find a nontrivial factor of an input unsigned integer. It might fail.
input:
	Input an input unsigned integer 'number' to cin.
output:
	Print on the screen a nontrivial factor of 'number' if found, or "Failure" if not found.


sub-function:

bool pollard_rho(mpz_t d, const mpz_t n)
	The implementation of pollard-rho algorithm. Used to find a nontrivial factor of an input unsigned integer. It might fail.
input:
	An initialized mpz_t number d, used to store the factor found.
	An initialized mpz_t number n, storing the input unsigned integer.
output:
	A bool which is 1 if a nontrivial factor is found and stores in d, and 0 otherwise.
