functions:

void RSA(int level, mpz_t m)
	complete the whole RSA processes, including generating keys (p,q,n,e,d), encrypting, and decrypting
input:
	an integer 'level' representing the security level (must be selected among 80,112,128,192,and 256)
	an mpz_t number 'm' which is initialized and stores the message to be encrypted
output:
	Print the process results on screen.


key_p_q generate(int level)
	takes as input a security level and generate p and q such that n is long enough to match the required security level
input: 
	an integer 'level' representing the security level (must be selected among 80,112,128,192,and 256)
output: 
	a key_p_q which is struted as {mpz_t p; mpz_t q; mpz_t n} where n is long enough to match the required security level


void encrypt(mpz_t c, mpz_t e, mpz_t m, mpz_t n)
	encrypt with c = m^e mod n
input: 
	mpz_t numbers c, e, m, and n which are all initialized
output: 
	None. The ciphertext is stored in c


void decrypt(mpz_t m, mpz_t d, mpz_t c, mpz_t n)
	encrypt with c = m^e mod n
input: 
	mpz_t numbers m, d, c and n which are all initialized
output: 
	None. The encrypted is stored in m
